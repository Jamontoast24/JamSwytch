Swytch croudfunding style page.


-Created a design for a croudfunding style page. It's an all-in-one page with an intro section, small gallery, payment section and a footer with links to the Swytch site.
-All links go to the other Swytch official pages and Social Media.

-I created the project with the branding and color coding in mind to match the rest of the Swytch website. This is my take on how I would do this style of page.
(*note, could not find the Campton font so used a different one, feel free to change the font-family to the one you prefer.)

-The purchase button leads the user to another page which thanks them for their order.

-I added a Javascript Timer telling the user how long is left on the current deal.

-Mobile Friendly.
